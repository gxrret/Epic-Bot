# Reddit Comment Bot Framework
Written in Python 3.7 and using PRAW, this reddit bot framework will get you started in creating a bot that can reply to any comment found that has specific text in the comment body.

Replace placeholders with your own.

# Configuration
Create config.py file and import it with the following criteria:
  1. client_id
  2. client_secret
  3. username
  4. password

# Setup
To create this, you must create a Reddit app inside your preferences on your Reddit account. https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
Name it whatever you want, just select the script type, your client secret and client id will display. The redirect URI does not matter, just enter a placeholder domain.
